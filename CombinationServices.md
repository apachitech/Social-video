# Alternative Deployment Stacks for Vidora

While the primary deployment case uses a powerful combination of Vercel and Render, the modern cloud ecosystem offers several other excellent "best-in-class" stacks that you can assemble using free-tier services. Each stack has unique advantages, whether for simplicity, global performance, or learning a specific ecosystem.

This guide explores three popular and effective alternative combinations.

---

## Stack 1: The "All-in-One" Supabase Stack

This stack prioritizes development speed and simplicity by consolidating the backend, database, and storage into a single, cohesive platform.

*   **Frontend:** Vercel or Netlify
*   **Backend:** Supabase Edge Functions
*   **Database:** Supabase (PostgreSQL)
*   **File Storage:** Supabase Storage

### Why this stack is great:
*   **Simplicity:** Supabase provides a unified dashboard and a single client library for database access, authentication, file storage, and serverless functions. This dramatically reduces the complexity of managing multiple services.
*   **Speed of Development:** Auto-generated APIs for your database and a simple workflow for deploying serverless functions (written in Deno/TypeScript) mean you can build and iterate incredibly fast.
*   **Integrated Auth:** Supabase has a powerful, built-in authentication service that handles user sign-ups, logins, and social providers out of the box.

### Deployment Highlights:
1.  **Sign Up:** Create an account on [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) and your chosen frontend host (e.g., [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)).
2.  **Create Supabase Project:** This single step provisions your PostgreSQL database, storage bucket, and authentication service.
3.  **Get API Keys:** From your Supabase project dashboard, get your **Project URL** and `anon` **public key**. These are the only two environment variables your frontend will need.
4.  **Backend Logic:** Write your custom backend logic (e.g., for processing a payment) as **Supabase Edge Functions** and deploy them using the Supabase CLI.
5.  **Frontend Deployment:** Deploy your frontend to Vercel, adding `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` and `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` to the environment variables.

## Stack 2: The "Global Performance" Stack

This stack is optimized for raw speed, security, and low latency for users across the globe.

*   **Frontend:** Cloudflare Pages
*   **Backend:** Fly.io
*   **Database:** PlanetScale (Serverless MySQL)
*   **File Storage:** Backblaze B2 (fronted by Cloudflare CDN)

### Why this stack is great:
*   **Unmatched Speed:** Cloudflare Pages leverages one of the world's fastest CDNs for your frontend. By also using Cloudflare's CDN for your Backblaze B2 storage, you get free, high-speed bandwidth for all your media assets.
*   **Global Backend:** Fly.io deploys your backend as Docker containers in regions close to your users, significantly reducing API latency.
*   **Scalable Database:** PlanetScale is a serverless MySQL platform built for extreme scale, offering features like database branching that are fantastic for CI/CD workflows.

### Deployment Highlights:
1.  **Frontend:** Connect your GitHub repo to Cloudflare Pages for instant, continuous deployment.
2.  **Backend:** Dockerize your Node.js backend (a `Dockerfile` is required) and deploy it from the command line using the `flyctl` CLI.
3.  **Database:** Create a database on PlanetScale and get the connection string for your backend environment variables on Fly.io.
4.  **File Storage:**
    *   Create a bucket in Backblaze B2.
    *   In your Cloudflare dashboard, configure it to act as a CDN for your B2 bucket. This is the key step to making your storage fast and free to serve.

## Stack 3: The "AWS Free Tier" Stack

This stack is for developers who want to learn and operate within the powerful Amazon Web Services (AWS) ecosystem. It's more complex to set up but offers immense power and a clear path to scale.

*   **Frontend:** AWS S3 + Amazon CloudFront
*   **Backend:** AWS Lambda + Amazon API Gateway (Serverless) or AWS EC2 (Virtual Server)
*   **Database:** Amazon DynamoDB (NoSQL) or Amazon RDS (free tier)
*   **File Storage:** AWS S3

### Why this stack is great:
*   **Single Ecosystem:** All your infrastructure is managed through a single, powerful console.
*   **Deep Integration:** AWS services are designed to work together seamlessly. You can trigger backend logic (Lambda) directly from database events (DynamoDB Streams) or file uploads (S3 Events).
*   **Proven Scalability:** This is the same foundational infrastructure used by giants like Netflix and Airbnb.

### Deployment Highlights:
1.  **Frontend:**
    *   Create an S3 bucket and configure it for "static website hosting".
    *   Upload your frontend's `dist` folder to the bucket.
    *   Create an **Amazon CloudFront distribution** and point it to your S3 bucket to provide a global CDN and free SSL.
2.  **Backend (Serverless Approach):**
    *   Rewrite your Express routes into individual **AWS Lambda functions**.
    *   Use **Amazon API Gateway** to create HTTP endpoints that trigger your Lambda functions.
3.  **Backend (Server Approach):**
    *   Launch a free-tier `t2.micro` **EC2 instance**.
    *   SSH into the instance, install Node.js and Git, clone your repository, and run your backend server using a process manager like `pm2`.
4.  **Security:** Use **IAM (Identity and Access Management)** roles to securely grant permissions between your services (e.g., allowing your Lambda function to access your DynamoDB table) instead of using hard-coded keys.
